Installation Process Used
-Install Python 3.3 using msi
-Download get-pip.py
-Run get-pip.py (double click. Python Launcher for Windows)
-Open command prompt
-navigate to python program foler
-navigate to scripts folder
-run command "pip.exe install Complexity"

Concerns
-installing Python and Pip are rather easy. Complexity a tad bit less so. 
--Pip's py file will cue an installation. Complexity's won't.
-Requires the command line.
--quick start instructions are in unix. Windows commands are a lot longer (file paths)

Proposed Solutions
- Possible automation of installation process?
--batch or exe file that would check for python installation and run the proper command?
--there are no global environment variables for python's installation to make the job easier. May need to manually check drive for python installations
