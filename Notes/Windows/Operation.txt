Operation Process used
-Open command prompt
-navigate to python directory
-navigate to scripts directory
-run command "complexity.exe <directory>"

concern
-presently using command line
--must determine if command line is the sole execution method
-privilege and directory issues may keep the server from running
--e.g. school computers using multiple network and physical drives in tandem

Possible Solution
-Potential GUI implementation in place of command line execution
